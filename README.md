MEHANet:Enhanced Hierarchical Attention Network with Mamba for Simultaneous Hippocampus and Amygdala Segmentation

The hippocampus and amygdala, pivotal brain structures for memory and emotion, pose significant challenges for accurate and simultaneous segmentation due to their close anatomical proximity. This study proposes a Mamba-enhanced hierarchical attention network (MEHA-Net) specifically designed for precise concurrent segmentation of these structures in brain MRI images. The Mamba model, an improvement over traditional state-space models, is integrated as a residual structure within the convolutional network backbone to enhance local feature extraction without increasing model complexity. Furthermore, a hierarchical attention mechanism incorporating attention gates for low-level features and self-attention from transformers for high-level features is employed to suppress irrelevant regions and facilitate long-range dependencies. Evaluated on a dataset of 100 brain MRI images, the proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 93.4% for hippocampus segmentation and 91.0% for amygdala segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art models. These results underscore the efficacy of MEHA-Net for multi-target segmentation in dense data scenarios, demonstrating its superiority in simultaneous segmentation of the hippocampus and amygdala.
